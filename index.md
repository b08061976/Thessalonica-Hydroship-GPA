title: Thessalonica Hydroship (Upstream) and SMS Hydrogen (Downstream) Extracted Report Data (December 2024)
---

Thessalonica Hydroship converts ocean energy into renewable electricity or green hydrogen, takes all the dissolved CO2 and makes non-fossil natural gas. This means recycling all that CO2 into a drop-in fuel that is compatible with the whole world today, at highly competitive long-term benchmark pegged prices.

No chemicals to mess around with the chemistry of our ocean, no dumping of electrolysis brine, no sea-bed drilling.

How it works:

    One or more Thessalonica Hydroship vessel operating within a designated Gas Production Area ("GPA") are hooked to a grid of underwater ocean current turbines that generates 24 X 7 X 365 electricity.

    This baseload electricity is supplied to an onboard electrolyzer plant to produce hydrogen from seawater.

    The electrolysis brine by-product is never discharged, but minerals and metals such as magnesium are extracted from the brine.

    The oceans are at the moment over-saturated with carbon dioxide (CO2), this is captured and combined in an off-the-shelf methanation unit to produce non-fossil natural gas product (or RFNBO gas).

    The RFNBO gas is produced in non-fossil CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) form for a significantly lower GHG intensity when compared to LNG liquefaction.

Commercial Viability:

    Each Thessalonica Hydroship GPA is located within 1000 to 350 nautical miles to each intended CNG / Hydrogen demand market. This reduces the transportation cost per MMbtu and associated carbon intensity of the non-fossil CNG and/or Hydrogen gas.

    The minerals and metals produced from the electrolysis brine by-product translates into even lower cost of production for the hydrogen and non-fossil RFNBO CNG.

    Much of the plant and equipment to implement this, are already proven and matured technology at the commercial production field phase, such as (i) electrolyzers for hydrogen, (ii) equipment to extract CO2 from seawater, (iii) equipment to extract minerals from brine. This high and mature TRL level for the core pieces of the required plant and equipment lowers deployment risks substantially.

    The chosen partner for performance validation and operating monitoring for each Thessalonica Hydroship GPA is RINA Italy, the world's oldest marine classification society and highly reputable and well respected third party cargo and vessel inspection authority.

    The intended production of non-fossil CNG in addition to hydrogen product creates low market risks, since CNG or natural gas is readily the second largest energy source, after oil, and coal, and since fossil fuels are under pressure to decarbonize or face the risk of being phased down in the future, a RINA inspected, and performance verified, non-fossil CNG produced from Thessalonica Hydroship GPA presents an attractive long-term and strategic market entry for non-fossil fuels.

More Details:

While Thessalonica Hydroship GPA is designed to operate in offshore and upstream environments, the project developer (5M Renewables) has also engineered a downstream system by the name of SMS Hydrogen (Name abbreviation for "Shallow Marine System"), also termed by the developer as a SMS Hydrogen Refinery Hub.

SMS Hydrogen Refinery Hub

A downstream SMS Hydrogen Refinery Hub is located in shallow waters closer to the coast than a far-offshore, deep-water Thessalonica Hydroship GPA. Its downstream functions are as follows:

    Receive hydrogen or non-fossil natural gas product from the GPA to convert and refine into required end products such as methanol, ammonia or SAF (sustainable aviation fuel).

    The SMS Hydrogen refinery hub operates and gets it's energy supply from a trio of floating solar, offshore wind and tidal energy, this means the total carbon GHG intensity of the end product refined (e-methanol, e-ammonia, SAF) is very low.

    The SMS Hydrogen refinery hub is also capable of storing different refined products (e-methanol, e-ammonia, SAF) on this floating SMS Hydrogen platform.

Notes:

Based on the above functions, it seems that the economic advantages will be as follows:

SMS Hydrogen refinery hub developed by 5M Renewables is a coastal floating platform that is designed to receive renewable hydrogen from any offshore production and convert this hydrogen into efuels and chemicals such as e-methanol, ammonia and SAFs.

Why and what are its core advantages?

    No land use allows for rapid deployment anywhere.
    Modularization of onboard equipment on each SMS Hydrogen platform streamlines cost of build.
    Ability for integration of separate renewable power sources from offshore wind, tidal and floating solar PV grids.
    Scalability and plant process flexibility as additional modules can be operationally linked to the SMS Hydrogen platform, for instance, incremental floating storage of refined product such as methanol tanks.
    When both Thessalonica Hydroship and SMS Hydrogen Refinery Hub are operated together, this is likely to become a highly organized and developed energy infrastructure system that can handle both the upstream and downstream processing of using renewable energy and non-fossil carbon dioxide sources to generate both transition fuels like RFNBO non-fossil CNG / LNG, and future net zero fuels such as compressed or liquid hydrogen, e-ammonia.
